DataAnalysis Package

First log into a node and set up ROOT:
	srun --pty -c 4 --time=0-12:00:00 bash
	source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/LCG_98python3/ROOT/v6.22.00/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/ROOT-env.sh

Then run scripts in this order (commands to run are indented)


MyPythiaSimul.cc
----------------
Generates events using Pythia simulator and implements the detector effects.
Outputs a file with truth-level and reco-level data.
Output: pythia-outputs/data.root
Runs with:
	cd run-pythia
	./MyPythia8Simul MyPythia8Simul.cmnd -outroot data
where the last field, "data", sets the name of the output file to "data.root", 
it is automatically saved to the directory pythia-outputs/


MyDetectorSimul.C
-----------------
Takes the truth-level variables generated by MyPythiaSimul.cc and creates reco-level
variables based on the code in this script. Only use this script if you want to edit
the detector effects. Outputs a file to the directory detector-simul with truth-level 
and new reco-level data. The output file has the same name as the original file.
Input: pythia-outputs/data.root
Output: detector-simul/data.root
Runs with:
	cd detector-simul
	root -x -l -q MyDetectorSimul.C


MyAnalysis.C
------------
Runs the analysis on the ntuple, defines variables and flags, creates histograms.
At the very top you can specify the name of the output file.
At the bottom of the script in the main function, you can decide whether you want 
to analyze all the files in the directory pythia-outputs/, or make a list of the 
specific files in that directory that you want to analyze.
Input: data.root
Output: analysis.root
Runs with:
	cd analyze-pythia
	root -x -l -q MyAnalysis.C


PlotMacro.C
--------------------
Plots observables, saves plots as png's in analyze-pythia/plots/ directory.
Runs with:
	root -x -l -q PlotMacro.C
** Doesn't work now since the new version of the framework has new variable names, but it can be a good reference/example!
